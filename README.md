# AndroidAPIProject

This summer, I am working on a project that combines my interest in hockey with my passion for learning new technologies in computer science. Specifically, through this project I hoped to learn more about Android Studio and making API calls.

I used an API that provided data and stats about all current NHL teams and players. The documentation can be found here: https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/blob/master/stats-api.md

Although Android Studio definitely has a steep learning curve, I am quickly become more adept with understanding how to use Activities to link multiple pages, how to design UI using XML, and combining these aspects to make a functional application.
